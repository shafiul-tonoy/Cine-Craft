            Moana 2 is still making a splash at the domestic box office.
          </h2>
          <p className= 'p-5' >
            The Disney animated sequel added $11.7 million on Friday, on its way
            to $50.8 million for its second weekend of release. After setting a
            new Thanksgiving box office record last week with $225 million over
            the five-day holiday frame, the film’s domestic total is expected to
            reach just south of $300 million through Sunday. “Moana 2” was
            originally conceived as a Disney+ series, but the studio’s decision
            to rework the project into a theatrical sequel has proven
            worthwhile, despite mixed reviews. Dwayne Johnson and Auli’i
            Cravalho reprise their voice roles as the tattooed demigod Maui and
            the titular Polynesian heroine, respectively, in the film.
